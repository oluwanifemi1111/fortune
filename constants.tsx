  { text: "Through pressure. Through expectations. Through silent battles no one sees." },
  { text: "And somehow… you still carry softness in your heart." },
  { text: "You are chaos and calm in one body. Playful but deep. Sensitive but strong. Multi-talented but still humble about it." },

  { text: "I’m here when it’s messy. When it’s overwhelming. When you feel too sensitive for this world." },
  { text: "Because the world may not always understand your chaos… but it needs your light." }
